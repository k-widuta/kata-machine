## Greedy algorithms
> Greedy algorithms make short-sighted optimization choices, and as such are good at finding local maximums. If the local maximum isn't also the global maximum, then greedy algorithms can result in sub-optimal solutions.

> When it comes to the kind of graph traversal we've been doing (Dijkstra), the local maximum is guaranteed to be the global maximum, so Dijkstra's can guarantee the shortest path.

### LOCAL MAXIMUMS
Greedy algorithms are bad when the solution space has many local maximums:

### NO LOCAL MAXIMUMS
Greedy algorithms are great when the local maximum is the global maximum
