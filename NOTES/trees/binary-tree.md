> Representation usually is the first step to understanding the problem, as long as you know what shapes you're working with, the rest isn't too hard.

- each level of balanced binary tree is approx. half the size of the tree above (including this level)
- **Depth-first search** preserves tree shape, while breadth-first search does not.
