## A* SEARCH ALGORITHM

### WHY USE A*? (PRONOUNCED A-STAR)
The `A*` Search algorithm is one of the best and most popular techniques used in path-finding.

`A*` algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques like `Dijkstra's` and `Bellman-Ford`, has "brains". A* is a "smart" algorithm It differentiates itself from other conventional algorithms through the use of heuristics.

### WHAT IS A HEURISTIC?
> Heuristics in computer science and artificial intelligence are “rules of thumb” used in algorithms to assist in finding faster solutions to complex problems.

With a good heuristic, A* can still guarantee 100% accuracy, but a bad heuristic can result in a suboptimal solution.

### REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
Many video games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the approximated shortest path very efficiently.
